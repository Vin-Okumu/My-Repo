# Dry Eye Disease

This project stems from curiosity about what leads to dry eye disease. Here I embark on developing a model that can link underlying parameters to identify variables that best predict the incidence of dry eye disease. I explore correlations between lifestyle factors such as daily steps, sleep time, pulse measurement, blood pressure, eating and drinking habits, stress levels, medical issues such as anxiety, hypertension, asthma, etc., and any medication used with basic ocular attributes used to predict the presence of dry eye disease and ocular health in general. The dataset used herein can be used for machine learning models, statistical analysis, and clinical decision-making to enhance early detection and personalized treatment strategies for DED. It can also be used to predict another severe sleep-related disease such as insomnia which can be directly linked with ocular surface diseases (OSD).

The dataset used in this analysis is hosted on **Kaggle**:
